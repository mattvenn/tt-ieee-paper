\section{Beyond the Scan Chain}
\label{sec:beyond_scanchain}
The biggest limitation of the scan chain based architecture was its IO bandwidth and latency.
As a result, a new architecture was needed for Tiny Tapeout 04 and proposals were gathered from the community.
An online video call was held with community members, and the ten submitted architecture proposals discussed.
The winning architecture was a straightforward multiplexer design, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplexer_design}. This architecture was chosen as the simplest to implement while providing the most benefit in terms of additional IOs and higher bandwidth.

The physical layout (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TT03_5_test_design}) consists of a central controller connected up and down to two vertical spines.
Twenty-four horizontal muxes connect to the spines, each of which supports 16 designs.
This allows for up to 384 separate single tile designs.
The new architecture also enabled multiple tile designs, allowing a maximum project size of $8 \times 2$ tiles or $1359 \times \qty{225}{\um\squared}$---around \num{20000} logic cells. Table~\ref{tab:comparison_TT03_TT04} shows the key differences between Tiny Tapeout 03 and Tiny Tapeout 04.

Another major limitation of Tiny Tapeout 01 to Tiny Tapeout 03 was the small number of IO pins.
The scan controller used nine GPIOs to select the currently active design. While this simplified the demonstration board board, it also wasted valuable IO pins.

With Tiny Tapeout 04 the parallel design selection architecture used in previous chips was dropped in favor of a serial protocol.
The extra pins were then used bidirectionally, giving each design a clock pin, reset pin, and 24 IO pins.

An invitational experimental shuttle dubbed Tiny Tapeout 03.5 ~\cite{tinytapeout03p5} was submitted for production, with 32 designs, to Efabless chipIgnite 2306C.
Two of the designs included a power gate as a stepping stone to supporting analog and mixed signal designs.

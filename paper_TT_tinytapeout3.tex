\section{Tiny Tapeout 3}
\label{sec:tinytapeout3}

For Tiny Tapeout 3 the two clock buffers of Tiny Tapeout 1 and 2 were replaced by an inverting clock buffer design, with only one buffer between the clock input and output. Fig. ~\ref{fig:TT02_vs_TT03} shows a comparison between the TT02 and TT03 clock buffer designs. By inverting the clock between each design any asymmetry in the clock pulse is evenly spread across the negative and positive cycles.

%Again, this needs expansion. Maybe each Tiny Tapeout section should start with a paragraph detailing when it opened for submissions, when it closed, how many submissions there were, when and on what shuttle it was sent for manufacture, and when hardware was received (or when it will be received, where it hasn't arrived yet.

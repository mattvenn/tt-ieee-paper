\section{Tiny Tapeout 2}
\label{sec:tinytapeout2}

To address the issue of accidental macro block removal encountered in Tiny Tapeout 1, Tiny Tapeout 2 moved the scan chain into a discrete macro block. This was present in all designs, but could not be modified by participants.

As with Tiny Tapeout 1, designs in in Tiny Tapeout 2 used two clock buffers, with the internal flops driven after the first buffer.

%This needs to be expanded upon: what other changes were there in TT2? If there were no other changes, were there more participants in TT2 than TT1? Was anything else changed?

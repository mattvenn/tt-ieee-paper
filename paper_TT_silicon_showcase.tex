\section{Silicon Showcase}
\label{sec:silicon_showcase}

A curated list showcasing the types of designs possible through Tiny Tapeout is provided below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Serial FPGA~\cite{showcaseserialfpga}, a one fracturable 5-LUT that receives FPGA LUT configuration frames, serially evaluates LUT inputs and LUT outputs.
    \item Synthesizable digital temperature sensor~\cite{showcasetempsense}. By creatively twisting the use of a tristate-inverter (EINVP) a voltage DAC is built. This voltage-mode DAC is used to bias an NMOS into subthreshold operation to discharge the input capacitor of an inverter. Since the subthreshold current of a MOSFET is a strong function of temperature, the resulting delay time is also a strong function of temperature, thus a digital temperature sensor is built.
    \item 395 standard cells with multiplexer~\cite{showcasemicrotapeout}, this design contains a copy of most standard cells in the sky130_fd_sc_hd library along with a multiplexing mechanism that allows exposing any of them to the input/output pins.
    \item FM transmitter with I2S input~\cite{showcasefmtx}. This design takes an audio signal and modulates it to a higher carrier frequency, using FM modulation. The modulator in this design is based on a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) with several modifications.
    \item USB Full Speed device~\cite{showcaseusb}. This is a hardware implementation of a USB device end hardware interface, should be compliant with USB1.1 FS/LS (not HS).
    \item A Linux capable RISC-V CPU~\cite{showcasekianv}. This design is an RV32IMA RISC-V processor that aims to boot and run uLinux.
\end{itemize}
